## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

#1.makeCacheMatrix helps in storing a matrix and it's computed inverse in the cache. 
#2.cacheSolve checks if any value of inverse is there in the cache and if yes then it displays it's value . Otherwise, it computes the
#inverse of the matrix stored in the cache and stores the computed value in the inv variable present inside the set_inverse function.


## Write a short comment describing this function

##makeCacheMatrix takes a matrix as an argument. The get_matrix function displays the content of the matrix passed as an argument.
#set_matrix helps in overwriting the existing values of the matrix with new values. set_inverse takes the value of inverse as an 
#argument. This value of inverse is the value stored in cache . The <<- operator is used to assign a value to an object 
#in an environment that is different from it's current environment. This is done so that changes made in variables x and inv are saved,
#since now they are assigned in an environment enclosing the environment in which they are defined. 
#get_inverse gives the value of the inverse of the matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  
  inv<-NULL
  
  set_matrix<-function(y)
  {
    x<<-y
    inv<<-NULL
  }
  
  get_matrix<-function(){ x }
  
  set_inverse<-function(inverse)
  {
    inv<<-inverse
  }
  
  get_inverse<-function(){  inv }
  
  list(set_matrix=set_matrix, get_matrix=get_matrix, set_inverse=set_inverse, get_inverse=get_inverse)

## Write a short comment describing this function


##cacheSolve is a function that basically assigns the inverse value of the matrix inputted by the user of the programme.It first checks
#if a computed value of inverse has been inputted by the user or not. If it has been inputted, then it displays the value of the inverse
#and the programme ends there.This is done to prevent recomputing of the already computed inverse value. If no value of inverse has been 
#inputted then it finds the inverse of the matrix present in the cache(this matrix is stored in cache using makeCacheMatrix function) 
#and displays the result. The computed inverse is also assigned to inv variable present inside the set_inverse function.
